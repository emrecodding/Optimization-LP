# Optimization with Pyomo
### Here is a Linear Problem for assignment with pyomo, gurobi.

### In this part, I chose some sample datas for application.

### There are some goods and plants which can produce them. The hours column means the necessary hours to produce 100 kg.

### As you can see, some products can be produced at different plant with different hours.

### The objective function is to assign the most amount using plant that has minimum hours. 

### You can use the Big M method to solve by handle. However, When the number of datas increase, you should probably prefer a solver.
